## 📏 Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

#### HTML Guidelines
```html
<!-- ✅ DO - Use semantic HTML -->
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<!-- ❌ DON'T - Div soup -->
<div class="header">
  <div class="nav">
    <div class="link">Home</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### CSS Guidelines
```css
/* ✅ DO - Use meaningful class names */
.game-container { }
.score-display { }
.restart-button { }

/* ❌ DON'T - Generic, meaningless names */
.box { }
.thing { }
.btn1 { }
```
#### JavaScript Guidelines
```js
// ✅ DO - Clear naming, short functions
function calculateFinalScore(baseScore, multiplier) {
  const bonus = calculateBonus(baseScore);
  return (baseScore + bonus) * multiplier;
}

// ✅ DO - Comment complex logic
// Calculate collision using AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)
function checkCollision(rect1, rect2) {
  return rect1.x < rect2.x + rect2.width &&
         rect1.x + rect1.width > rect2.x &&
         rect1.y < rect2.y + rect2.height &&
         rect1.y + rect1.height > rect2.y;
}

// ❌ DON'T - Vague names, long functions, no comments
function calc(b, m) {
  let x = b * 0.1;
  if(b > 100) x = b * 0.15;
  return (b + x) * m;
}
```
